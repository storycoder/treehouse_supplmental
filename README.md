# Joseph Treehouse Supplemental Work Repository

I created this to document my supplemental work I do along side my learning/work via the [Treehouse MOOGs](https://teamtreehouse.com/). 

Along with the programs I write, I will document further learning as needed in the program itself using the commenting feature.

I will eventually start wiki here to document my learning but for now, my observations and new found understandings can be found embeded in comments.
